# Hello!

This is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website I created to display some of my coding projects.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file, where I can tell you a little bit more about this site!

← `index.html`: This is the main web page. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the website. The CSS applies styles to the elements in the HTML page.

← `script.js`: JavaScript adds interactivity to the website. This file contains the logic that makes elements dynamic.
